One of my first development jobs, for this project I was contracted to build and online ROI calculator for LED lightsource upgrades in office buildings. I built the frontend with Bootstrap and all calculations are performed at client side. 


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/2019-04-03-LED-ROI/ROI_Sylvania_overview.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
