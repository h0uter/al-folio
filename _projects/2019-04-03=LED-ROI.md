One of my first development projects involved creating an online ROI calculator for assessing the financial benefits of upgrading to LED lighting in office buildings. I was contracted to build the frontend using Bootstrap, ensuring a user-friendly interface, while all the calculations are performed client-side for quick and responsive feedback. The calculator allows businesses to input their current lighting setup and compare it with LED alternatives, providing instant insights into potential cost savings and payback periods. This tool was designed to help decision-makers quickly evaluate the economic impact of transitioning to energy-efficient lighting solutions.
