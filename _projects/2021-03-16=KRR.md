This project involved developing a high level robot controller to automate the task of stocking shelves in supermarkets.
Using the [Knowrob framework](http://www.knowrob.org/) and [ROSPlan](https://kcl-planning.github.io/ROSPlan/documentation/) modules in the Robot Operating System (ROS), we programmed the robot to recognize different products, navigate store aisles, and place items on the correct shelves. We tested our system in a simulated environment of the [TU Delft AIRLab](http://airlab.3me.tudelft.nl/) with a Tiago robot. The goal was to create a practical, reliable solution for automating inventory management in retail settings.
