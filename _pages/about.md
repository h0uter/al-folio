I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a master's degree in Cognitive Robitics from Delft University of Technology.  I am academically passionate about the opportunities of combining mapping and task planning and practically interested in 'robotic DevOps' to enable working on robotic solutions with teams at scale.


Currently, I work as a robotics software engineer at TNO, the Dutch research institute. 
Here I focus on scaling experiments with our robotic concepts from our lab into the operational settings of our customers.


In my Masters I got hands-on experience with the [learning](/projects/2020-04-20=MLDG-project/), [reasoning](/projects/2021-03-16=KRR/), [computer vision](/projects/2020-10-25=ml-for-robotics-project/), [mapping](/projects/2021-01-08=machine-perception-project/) and [motion planning](/projects/2021-01-08=quadrotor-mp-project/) aspects of mobile robots. 
During my Bachelor I worked for [Skelex](https://www.skelex.com/) and I am proud to have represented them at many [industrial tech events](/projects/2019-04-02=Hannover-Messe-Skelex/) where I demonstrated their passive exoskeleton. I really enjoyed investigating the use cases of potential customers. Often times the exoskeletons would be used for physically demanding jobs for which 'the robot' was not good enough yet.


Additionally, I really enjoy looking at nature from an engineering perspective, because it inspires me on what is possible.
