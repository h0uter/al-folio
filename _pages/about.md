I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Delft University of Technology and am currently finishing my master's degree in Cognitive Robotics. 

<!-- Now with my studies I can  -->
I am academically passionate about the opportunities of [combining mapping and task planning](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2022-05-29-thesis/) and practically interested in 'robotic DevOps' in order to deploy robots 'into the wild' at scale.
Additionally, I have hands-on experience with the [learning](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2020-04-20-MLDG-project/), [reasoning](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2021-03-16-KRR/), [computer vision](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2020-10-25-ml-for-robotics-project/), [mapping](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2021-01-08-machine-perception-project/) and [motion planning](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2021-01-08-quadrotor-mp-project/) aspects of mobile robots. 
<!-- Especially the synergy and robotic devOps is what I plan to learn more about in the future. -->

During my Bachelor I worked for [Skelex](https://www.skelex.com/) and I am grateful to have represented them at many [industrial tech events](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2019-04-02-Hannover-Messe-Skelex/) where I demonstrated their passive exoskeleton. I really enjoyed investigating the use cases of potential customers. Often times the exoskeletons would be used for physically demanding jobs for which 'the robot' was not good enough yet.


<!-- I am also very interested in bionics.  -->
Additionally, I also really enjoy looking at nature from an engineering perspective, because it inspires me on what is possible.

<!-- since I believe that taking inspiration from nature is key to aproach to building better robots. -->

<!-- A strong source of motivation for me is my ambition to contribute to next-gen [robotic prosthetics development](https://youtu.be/CDsNZJTWw0w) at some point during my carreer. -->
