Currently, I work as a robotics software engineer at [TNO](https://www.tno.nl/en/), the Dutch research institute.
At TNO, my research focus is combining mapping and task planning to create actionable enviromental representations for robots. 
Additionally, I specialize in scaling robotic systems and teams from the experimental phase into operational concepts for our customers. 

I hold a master's degree in Cognitive Robotics and a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Delft University of Technology.
In my Masters I got hands-on experience with the [learning](/projects/2020-04-20=MLDG-project/), [reasoning](/projects/2021-03-16=KRR/), [computer vision](/projects/2020-10-25=ml-for-robotics-project/), [mapping](/projects/2021-01-08=machine-perception-project/) and [motion planning](/projects/2021-01-08=quadrotor-mp-project/) aspects of mobile robots.
During my Bachelor I worked for [Skelex](https://www.skelex.com/) and I am proud to have represented the passive exoskeleton technology we were working on at many [industrial tech events](/projects/2019-04-02=Hannover-Messe-Skelex/).
I really enjoyed investigating the use cases of potential customers. 
Often times the exoskeletons would be used for physically demanding jobs for which 'the robot' was not good enough yet.
