HiðŸ‘‹, my name is Wouter.

Welcome to my WIP portfolio site!

I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Delft University of Technology and am currently finishing my master's degree in Cognitive Robotics.

During my Bachelor I worked for [Skelex](https://www.skelex.com/) and I am gratefull to have visited many [industrial tech events](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2019-04-02-Hannover-Messe-Skelex/) to represent them and demonstrate their passive exo-skeleton. I really enjoyed investigating the usecases of potential customers. Often times the exo-skeletons would be used for physcially demanding jobs for which 'the robot' was not good enough yet.

My general academic interests relate to the [learning](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2020-04-20-MLDG-project/), [reasoning](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2021-03-16-KRR/) and [planning](https://h0uter.github.io/projects/2021-01-08-quadrotor-mp-project/) aspects of artificial agents. These seems to be the core challenges to bring robotics 'into the wild'.

I am also very interested in bionics, currently especially in taking inspiration from neuroscientific advances in understanding our brain as a Bayesian Inference machine. I believe that inspiration from nature is essential for building better robots.

A strong source of motivation for me is my ambition to contribute to next-gen [robotic prosthetics development](https://youtu.be/CDsNZJTWw0w) at some point during my carreer.
