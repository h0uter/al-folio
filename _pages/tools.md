Mechanical engineering in Dutch literally translates to toolmakership. Turns out software tools are just as useful and important! Here are some of the tools I enjoy using:

# Teamwork

## Pre-commit
> Sometimes you forget to run checks on your code, this program will automagically check the specific files you are committing with your preferred tools.

## Ruff
> The main benefit here is that is now all includes in one, much faster, tool.

## Gitkraken
> Allows me to better manage multiple projects that are composed of multiple repos each, by providing multi repo project overviews. 

## MKDocs
> Really great and polished experience for adding Automated documentation generated from Docstrings to your project.

## Zotero
> Reference manager that's not owned by evil publisher and the new Ipad app is actually really great!


# Personal

## z4h
> Natural and really sensible modern extension of the general shell experience

## PDM
> Respects PEP Standards for `pyproject.toml`, unlike Poetry.

# Technical

## Zenoh
> Distributed messaging that just works, with innovative new communication patterns.

## NiceGUI
> Because you can start with a frontend in 3 lines of Python code prototyping!
